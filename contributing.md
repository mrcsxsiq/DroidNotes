# Contributing Guide

## How to contribute

- Fork the project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR)

  - Explain what the PR fixes or improves.

  - If your PR aims to add a new resource to list, provide the address of the resource.



- Use sensible commit messages

  - If your PR fixes a separate issue number, include it in the commit message.



- Use a sensible number of commit messages as well

  - e.g. Your PR should not have 1000s of commits.
